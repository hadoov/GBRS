# Recommender
Graph-Based Recommender System 

It's a recommender system developed in python whcich is working for collaborative filtering. We create the graph based on similiarity
between users (according to the similiar ranks). In next level we extract the user graph features which are combining by some user
data. We use these features to clustering users and then suggest new items to different users based on the average ranks of 
their clusters.
